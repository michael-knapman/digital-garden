# Maize

Consider Maize, staple of populations from A to Zea.

The human domestication of the wild teosinte into maize is a continuous process that started eleven millennia ago.

Once a meager grass called teosinte, it is now a cereal, yellow and courageous.

The utter transformation of teosinte is not an affront to natural law, rather teosinte evolved to fit the needs of humans.

Over time, many humans became totally dependent on maize for survival.  
In return, maize became totally dependent on humans for reproduction.  
The two species are codependent, in a mutualistic symbiosis.

For its service to humanity, maize was rewarded by being spread across all the circuit of the earth.
If the goal of life is reproduction, maize wins amazingly.
