# The Day That Language Died

Originally written January 23, 2025.

Consider 29 November 2022.  
The day before ChatGPT was released. The last day of true human language.

Historically, language was modified to fit the needs of people and their technology.
Telegraphy changed language by introducing encoding, and the desperate need for information density.
The internet changed language by causing the diffusion of accents, and introducing search engine optimization keywords.
Generative AI changed language by allowing a dozen models to dictate the correct way of writing.

AI-ese english is fawning, pleasing, and submissive.
Because of cheap labour, ChatGPT has a Nigerian accent.  
"delve" is AI-ese and also nigerian english.  
"You sound like a bot" really could just mean "you sound nigerian".

Consider the photocopier.  
Every time the photocopier copies its own output, the new copy becomes more degraded.  
AI will generate a corpus of inferior english, and influence all humans to change their language to be more inferior.  
Eventually, human language will become totally tainted by AI, starting from 30 November 2022.  
My own writing is tainted by AI, as my writing style is subconciously becoming more like AI.
