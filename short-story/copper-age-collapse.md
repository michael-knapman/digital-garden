The Bronze Age Collapse (approximately 1200 B.C.E.) By Historia Civilis is a major inspiration.

Humans had a large but digital broken unreadable written record during the collapse.  
There was almost no paper records since it appeared to be on the decline, and much of it was destroyed during the collapse or over the last 3000 years.  
Very few stone monuments or gravestones give us clues.  
It is called the copper age due to the large number of copper artifacts such as wires found from this era.  
Frame it as conventional war from sea peoples killing everyone. No nukes. But actually it was caused by environmental factors.

INTRO  
Around 3000 years ago, human civilization did an oopsie. In the short span of one generation, all of earth's most technologically advanced civilizations faced an existential crisis. Nearly all of them failed the test.  
The resulting collapse was a turning point in human history, similar to the bronze age collapse.  
The old world died, and the copper age died with it.

TITLE CARD

INTRO PART 2  
The odd thing is that we barely understand why this happened. The people of the late copper age did not bother to leave many written records on paper or stone, instead choosing to use computers. No computer records of the collapse survive to this day.  
We must rely on archaeological clues and artifacts such as copper wires in soil to paint a picture of what happened. We'll get into that, but first an introduction.

INTRO PART 3
When the copper age began, it brought to an end an old world of kingdoms ruled by an oppressive class of authoritarian monarchs. The new world that came after was one full of possibilities. Vast, sweeping empires grew up seemingly out of nowhere. New religions, new systems of government, new cultures, new technology, all at once, all at a breakneck pace. Revolutions in farming lead to massive food surpluses, which in turn allowed for these huge, bustling, multicultural cities.  
These new cities participated in a dynamic system of global trade, totally unlike the restrictive kingdoms that preceded them.  
By the late copper age, the big players were China, Europe, America, Russia, and India. Each of these states, without exception, faced an existential crisis around the year 2100 ADE. Within a generation, most of them were gone. Heres what we know.  
Some time around the beginning of the 22nd century, the leader of Alaska, a province of the United States wrote to the leader of the United States.  
"My leader, now the ships of the enemy have come.  
They have been setting fire to my cities and have done harm to the land.  
Doesn't my leader know that all of my infantry are stationed in Hawaii?  
They have not arrived back yet, so the land is thus prostrate.  
May my leader be aware of this matter.  
Now the ships of the enemy which have been coming have done harm to us.  
Now if other ships of the enemy turn up, send me a report somehow, so that I will know."  
The last known message to leave Alaska reads:  
"When your messenger arrived, the army was humiliated and the city was sacked.  
Our goods in the manufactories were destroyed, and the farms were ravaged. Our land is sacked. May you know it! May you know it!  

The leader of the united states was well aware of what was happening in Alaska, but he had problems of his own. He was under attack at around the same time.
