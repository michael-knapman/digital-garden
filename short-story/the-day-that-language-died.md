# The Day That Language Died

Written January 23, 2025.


30 November 2022.  
Take a look at Wikipedia on November 29. The day before AI generated text. The last day of true human language.  
AI-ese are all languages made by AI. For example AI english is fawning, pleasing, with a Nigerian accent.  
"delve" is Ai-ese and also nigerian english.  
"You sound like a bot" really could just mean "you sound nigerian".

Consider the photocopier.  
Every time the photocopier copies its own output, the new copy becomes more degraded.  
AI will generate a corpus of inferior english, and influence all humans to change their language to be more inferior.  
Eventually, human language will become totally tainted by AI, starting from 30 November 2022.  
My own writing is tainted by AI, as my writing style is subconciously becoming more like AI.
