On 28 January 2026, I came across a video called Pokemon R/S/E Remix: Route 113 by PokeRemixStudio.

I saw that I left a comment on the video from 5 years ago saying:  WHOA Pilotredsun is making pokemon music again! HOLY CRUD. Welcome back PRS, I love your work
I put a new comment that said: In hindsight this is actually a classic example of a swan song: A final musical effort, particularly beautiful, before the death of a swan.  

I wanted to see more discourse about PokeRemixStudio online so I found https://publish.obsidian.md/myaiba/Z0+Zettels/PokeRemixStudio+Was+a+High+Schooler+When+I+was+Their+Biggest+Fan  
Importantly, this person did not make this post in a blog, but instead in a Digital Garden.
Becuase of this, I was inspired to make a robust and easily shared digital garden, Git tracked over time.
