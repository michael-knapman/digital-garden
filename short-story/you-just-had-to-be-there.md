# You Just Had To Be There

Some social phenomena were best enjoyed as they were happening.

Consider Homestuck in 2011. It was a cultural phenomenon, with its fandom doing insane things on a daily basis.  
Readers would obsess over the comic, with update notifiers on their websites activating every 6 hours.  
You just had to be there.
